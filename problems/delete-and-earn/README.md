## [740. Delete and Earn (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn "删除并获得点数")

<p>Given an array <code>nums</code> of integers, you can perform operations on the array.</p>

<p>In each operation, you pick any <code>nums[i]</code> and delete it to earn <code>nums[i]</code> points. After, you must delete <b>every</b> element equal to <code>nums[i] - 1</code> or <code>nums[i] + 1</code>.</p>

<p>You start with <code>0</code> points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,4,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points.
6 total points are earned.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 9
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2&#39;s and the 4.
Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
9 total points are earned.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
</ul>

<summary>Hint 1</summary>
If you take a number, you might as well take them all.  Keep track of what the value is of the subset of the input with maximum M when you either take or don't take M.
