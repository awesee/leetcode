## [566. Reshape the Matrix (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/reshape-the-matrix "重塑矩阵")

<p>In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.
</p>

<p>
You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two <b>positive</b> integers <b>r</b> and <b>c</b> representing the <b>row</b> number and <b>column</b> number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.</p>

 <p>The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same <b>row-traversing</b> order as they were.
</p>

<p>
If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.
</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 1, c = 4
<b>Output:</b> 
[[1,2,3,4]]
<b>Explanation:</b><br>The <b>row-traversing</b> of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 2, c = 4
<b>Output:</b> 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
<b>Explanation:</b><br>There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So output the original matrix.
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br>
<ol>
<li>The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100].</li>
<li>The given r and c are all positive.</li>
</ol>
</p>
