## [499. The Maze III (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze-iii "迷宫 III")

<p>There is a <b>ball</b> in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go through empty spaces by rolling <b>up</b> (u), <b>down</b> (d), <b>left</b> (l) or <b>right</b> (r), but it won&#39;t stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction. There is also a <b>hole</b> in this maze. The ball will drop into the hole if it rolls on to the hole.</p>

<p>Given the <b>ball position</b>, the <b>hole position</b> and the <b>maze</b>, find out how the ball could drop into the hole by moving the <b>shortest distance</b>. The distance is defined by the number of <b>empty spaces</b> traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the hole (included). Output the moving <b>directions</b> by using &#39;u&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;l&#39; and &#39;r&#39;. Since there could be several different shortest ways, you should output the <b>lexicographically smallest</b> way. If the ball cannot reach the hole, output &quot;impossible&quot;.</p>

<p>The maze is represented by a binary 2D array. 1 means the wall and 0 means the empty space. You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls. The ball and the hole coordinates are represented by row and column indexes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input 1:</b> a maze represented by a 2D array

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0 0

<b>Input 2:</b> ball coordinate (rowBall, colBall) = (4, 3)
<b>Input 3:</b> hole coordinate (rowHole, colHole) = (0, 1)

<b>Output:</b> &quot;lul&quot;

<b>Explanation:</b> There are two shortest ways for the ball to drop into the hole.
The first way is left -&gt; up -&gt; left, represented by &quot;lul&quot;.
The second way is up -&gt; left, represented by &#39;ul&#39;.
Both ways have shortest distance 6, but the first way is lexicographically smaller because &#39;l&#39; &lt; &#39;u&#39;. So the output is &quot;lul&quot;.

<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input 1:</b> a maze represented by a 2D array

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0 0

<b>Input 2:</b> ball coordinate (rowBall, colBall) = (4, 3)
<b>Input 3:</b> hole coordinate (rowHole, colHole) = (3, 0)

<b>Output:</b> &quot;impossible&quot;

<b>Explanation:</b> The ball cannot reach the hole.

<p><b>Note:</b></p>

<ol>
	<li>There is only one ball and one hole in the maze.</li>
	<li>Both the ball and hole exist on an empty space, and they will not be at the same position initially.</li>
	<li>The given maze does not contain border (like the red rectangle in the example pictures), but you could assume the border of the maze are all walls.</li>
	<li>The maze contains at least 2 empty spaces, and the width and the height of the maze won&#39;t exceed 30.</li>
</ol>
