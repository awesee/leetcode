## 436. Find Right Interval (Medium)

<p>
Given a set of intervals, for each of the interval i, check if there exists an interval j whose start point is bigger than or equal to the end point of the interval i, which can be called that j is on the "right" of i.
</p>

<p>
For any interval i, you need to store the minimum interval j's index, which means that the interval j has the minimum start point to build the "right" relationship for interval i. If the interval j doesn't exist, store -1 for the interval i. Finally, you need output the stored value of each interval as an array.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br />
<ol>
<li>You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.</li>
<li>You may assume none of these intervals have the same start point.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [ [1,2] ]

<b>Output:</b> [-1]

<b>Explanation:</b> There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs -1.
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [ [3,4], [2,3], [1,2] ]

<b>Output:</b> [-1, 0, 1]

<b>Explanation:</b> There is no satisfied "right" interval for [3,4].
For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point;
For [1,2], the interval [2,3] has minimum-"right" start point.
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 3:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [ [1,4], [2,3], [3,4] ]

<b>Output:</b> [-1, 2, -1]

<b>Explanation:</b> There is no satisfied "right" interval for [1,4] and [3,4].
For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point.
</pre>
