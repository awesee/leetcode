## [1406. Stone Game III (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-iii "石子游戏 III")

<p>Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones <strong>arranged in a row</strong>, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array <code>stoneValue</code>.</p>

<p>Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player&#39;s turn, that player can take <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or <code>3</code> stones from the <strong>first</strong> remaining stones in the row.</p>

<p>The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player is <code>0</code> initially.</p>

<p>The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.</p>

<p>Assume Alice and Bob <strong>play optimally</strong>.</p>

<p>Return <code>&quot;Alice&quot;</code><em> if Alice will win, </em><code>&quot;Bob&quot;</code><em> if Bob will win, or </em><code>&quot;Tie&quot;</code><em> if they will end the game with the same score</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> values = [1,2,3,7]
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;Bob&quot;
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> values = [1,2,3,-9]
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;Alice&quot;
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.
If Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob&#39;s score becomes 5. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.
If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob&#39;s score becomes 3. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.
Remember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> values = [1,2,3,6]
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;Tie&quot;
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Alice cannot win this game. She can end the game in a draw if she decided to choose all the first three piles, otherwise she will lose.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= stoneValue.length &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>-1000 &lt;= stoneValue[i] &lt;= 1000</code></li>
</ul>

### Hints
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
The game can be mapped to minmax game. Alice tries to maximize the total score and Bob tries to minimize it.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Use dynamic programming to simulate the game. If the total score was 0 the game is "Tie", and if it has positive value then "Alice" wins, otherwise "Bob" wins.
