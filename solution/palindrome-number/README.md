## 9. Palindrome Number

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: 121
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**
```text
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
