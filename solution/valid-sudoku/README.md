## 36. Valid Sudoku

Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated `according to the following rules`:
  1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
  1. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
  1. Each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

A partially filled sudoku which is valid.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character `'.'`.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input:
[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input:
[
  ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being 
    modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
```
