## 687. Longest Univalue Path (Easy)

<p>Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.</p>

<p>
<b>Example 1:</b>
</p>


<p>
Input:
<pre>
              5
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          1   1   5
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Output:
<pre>
2
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<b>Example 2:</b>
</p>


<p>
Input:
<pre>
              1
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          4   4   5
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Output:
<pre>
2
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>
The given binary tree has not more than 10000 nodes.  The height of the tree is not more than 1000.
