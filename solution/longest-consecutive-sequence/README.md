## 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence (Hard)

<p>Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.</p>

<p>Your algorithm should run in O(<em>n</em>) complexity.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong>&nbsp;[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The longest consecutive elements sequence is <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code>. Therefore its length is 4.
